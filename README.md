# Simple hangman game written in C

I'm trying to improve my programming (and C) skills, so I decided to make this simple game.

## How to run it

You can even use some sort of online IDE to play it if you don't want to download anything. To do so, just copy the contents of `main.c` to said IDE.

If you choose to run it on your machine, use a compiler (I'm using [`gcc`](https://gcc.gnu.org/)) to compile it. For me, I type `$ gcc main.c -o game` in the terminal. Afterwards, run the binary producted with `./game`.
